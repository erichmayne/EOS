### Full Description

**Build habits that actually stick.**

The EOS helps you stay accountable to your fitness goals through the power of commitment. Set a daily push-up target, make a commitment deposit, and when you complete your goal — your funds stay available for withdrawal anytime.

Choose to support amazing charities with any uncommitted funds. It's accountability that gives back.

**How it works:**

1. **Set Your Goal** — Choose your daily push-up target (10, 50, 100 — you decide)
2. **Make a Commitment** — Deposit funds into your accountability wallet
3. **Complete & Keep** — Hit your daily goal and your balance stays fully available
4. **Give Back** — Support top-rated charities with any uncommitted funds

**Features:**

• 📱 **Live Push-Up Counter** — AI-powered camera tracks your reps in real-time
• ⏰ **Daily Deadlines** — Set your own deadline with countdown timer

**Why commitment works:**

Research shows that pre-commitment increases goal completion by up to 3x. When you've made a commitment, showing up becomes natural. The EOS harnesses this psychology to help you build lasting fitness habits.

**Supported Charities:**
GiveDirectly, Doctors Without Borders, St. Jude, Feeding America, UNICEF, American Red Cross, and more.

## App Review Notes

The EOS is a fitness accountability app that helps users build consistent push-up habits through voluntary commitment deposits.

**Core functionality:**
1. Users set personal daily push-up goals with customizable deadlines
2. Users can optionally deposit funds into their in-app wallet as a commitment mechanism
3. When users complete their daily goals, their full balance remains available for withdrawal
4. Users pre-select charities to support — any funds not withdrawn are periodically donated to the user's chosen charities

**Full User Consent & Control:**
- Deposits are 100% optional — the app works without any financial commitment
- Users choose their own commitment amount ($1, $5, $10, etc.)
- Users set their own goals (push-up count, deadline time, schedule)
- Users select which charities receive support from uncommitted funds
- Users can withdraw their full available balance
- No automatic charges to any payment method — all deposits are user-initiated
- Users must explicitly confirm each deposit before funds are added

**Key points:**
- This is a voluntary commitment tool, not a penalty system
- Users are never charged — they voluntarily pre-fund their own accountability wallet
- Similar model to savings/commitment apps (Qapital, Stickk, Beeminder) that have operated on the App Store for years
- The commitment mechanism is based on behavioral economics research showing pre-commitment improves goal achievement

The camera feature uses on-device pose detection (Vision framework) to count push-ups in real-time. No images are stored or transmitted.
