Turn your fitness goals into commitments. Set daily push-up objectives, put money on the line, and watch your consistency skyrocket.

### Full Description

**Stop breaking promises to yourself.**

EOS is the accountability app that makes your fitness goals real. Set a daily push-up objective, commit real money, and if you miss your goal — your stake goes to charity or a friend who'll hold you accountable.

**How it works:**

1. **Set Your Goal** — Choose your daily push-up target (10, 50, 100 — you decide)
2. **Put Skin in the Game** — Deposit funds and set your payout amount ($1, $5, $10+)
3. **Choose Your Stakes** — Miss a goal? Money goes to charity or a custom recipient
4. **Track & Crush It** — Real-time countdown, progress tracking, and live camera detection

**Features:**

• 📱 **Live Push-Up Counter** — AI-powered camera tracks your reps in real-time
• ⏰ **Daily Deadlines** — Set your own deadline with live countdown timer
• 💰 **Real Accountability** — Commit actual money to your goals
• 🎯 **Flexible Scheduling** — Daily or weekdays-only objectives
• ❤️ **Charity Payouts** — Support top-rated charities when you miss
• 👥 **Custom Recipients** — Add a friend to receive your missed-goal payouts
• 📊 **Progress Tracking** — See your streaks and history

**Why EOS works:**

Research shows that financial commitment increases goal completion by up to 3x. EOS leverages this psychology to help you build lasting habits. When your wallet is on the line, showing up becomes non-negotiable.

**Supported Charities:**
GiveDirectly, Doctors Without Borders, St. Jude, Feeding America, UNICEF, American Red Cross, and more.
