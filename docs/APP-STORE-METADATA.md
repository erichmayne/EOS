Build unbreakable fitness habits with commitment-based accountability. Set stakes on your goals and complete your daily objectives to keep your money.

### Full Description

**Build habits that actually stick.**

The EOS helps you stay accountable to your fitness goals through voluntary commitment contracts. Set your daily objective, put your money where your mouth is, and complete your goal to keep your funds.

It's simple: succeed and keep your money. That's real accountability.

**How it works:**

1. **Set Your Goal** — Choose your daily objective (push-ups, runs, etc.)
2. **Set Your Stakes** — Optionally put money at risk to hold yourself accountable
3. **Designate a Recipient** — Choose who receives forfeited stakes (friend, family, or EOS)
4. **Complete & Keep** — Hit your daily goal and your stakes stay in your balance

**Features:**

• **Live Counter** — AI-powered camera tracks your push-up reps in real-time
• **Daily Deadlines** — Set your own deadline with countdown timer
• **Voluntary Stakes** — Optional accountability with money you choose to put at risk
• **Flexible Scheduling** — Daily or weekdays-only goals
• **Custom Recipients** — Invite friends or family as your accountability partners
• **Progress Tracking** — See your streaks and consistency

**Why commitment contracts work:**

Research shows that pre-commitment increases goal completion by up to 3x. When you've put something at stake, showing up becomes natural. The EOS harnesses this psychology to help you build lasting fitness habits.

No penalties. No punishments. Just you, your commitment, and real stakes.

## App Review Notes

The EOS is a fitness accountability app that helps users build consistent habits through voluntary commitment contracts with financial stakes.

**IMPORTANT - This is NOT a penalty system:**
- Users voluntarily choose to set stakes on their own goals
- Users control the outcome entirely through their own effort and choice
- Success means keeping 100% of their money
- This is identical to the commitment contract model used by StickK (App Store since 2012) and Beeminder

**Core functionality:**
1. Users set personal daily fitness goals with customizable deadlines
2. Users can optionally set "Accountability Stakes" — money they put at risk to hold themselves accountable
3. Users designate a recipient (friend, family member, or EOS) who receives stakes if they miss their goal
4. When users complete their daily goals, their full balance remains available for withdrawal
5. If users miss their goal, the stakes go to their designated recipient

**Commitment Contract Framework:**
- Users explicitly acknowledge they are entering a voluntary commitment contract
- Users must check boxes confirming: stakes are voluntary, forfeited stakes are non-refundable, and they are 18+
- Users bear full responsibility for achieving their commitment
- This follows established commitment contract models (StickK.com has processed $50M+ in commitments)

**Full User Consent & Control:**
- Setting stakes is 100% optional — the app works without any financial commitment
- Users choose their own stakes amount ($10, $50, $100, etc.)
- Users set their own goals (objective type, target, deadline, schedule)
- Users select their designated recipient
- Users can withdraw their full available balance at any time
- No automatic charges — all deposits are user-initiated
- Users must acknowledge terms before setting stakes

**Key Legal Points:**
- This is a voluntary commitment tool based on behavioral economics
- Users are never "charged" or "penalized" — they voluntarily put their own money at stake
- The same model as StickK (App ID: 334468932, approved 2012, still active)
- Based on research by behavioral economists including those at Yale

The camera feature uses on-device pose detection (Vision framework) to count push-ups in real-time. No images are stored or transmitted.

**Account Deletion (Guideline 5.1.1v):**
- Account deletion is available in Profile > Account section > "Delete Account" button
- Users must enter their password to confirm deletion
- All user data is permanently deleted: account info, objectives, sessions, transaction history
- Deletion is immediate and cannot be undone
