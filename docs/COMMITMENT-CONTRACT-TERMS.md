# EOS Commitment Contract Terms

## Terms and Conditions of Accountability Agreement

This agreement is between you ("User") and EOS ("Company"). By setting Accountability Stakes in the EOS application, you agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. THE COMMITMENT

### 1.1 Your Commitment
User promises to perform their stated objective ("Commitment") as specified in the app. The Commitment includes the objective type, target, deadline, and schedule selected by the User.

### 1.2 Risk of Failure
User acknowledges that circumstances within or beyond User's control may prevent User from achieving the Commitment. **USER BEARS ALL RISK** associated with the Commitment, including User's efforts to satisfy the Commitment and User's ultimate success or failure in achieving it.

---

## 2. ACCOUNTABILITY STAKES

### 2.1 Voluntary Stakes
User may choose to set Accountability Stakes—an amount of money to be at risk if User does not complete their stated Commitment. **Setting Stakes is entirely optional.** User may use EOS without any financial commitment.

### 2.2 Stakes Amount
User is solely responsible for selecting the Stakes amount. User represents that any Stakes amount is an amount User can afford to lose.

### 2.3 Deposit and Forfeiture
User authorizes EOS to hold the Stakes amount in User's balance. If User fails to complete their Commitment by the specified deadline ("Failure"), the Stakes for that period will be forfeited ("Forfeited Stakes") and transferred to User's Designated Recipient.

### 2.4 Success
If User successfully completes their Commitment, Stakes remain in User's balance and are not forfeited.

---

## 3. DESIGNATED RECIPIENT

### 3.1 Selection
User must select a Designated Recipient before setting Stakes. The Designated Recipient is the party who will receive Forfeited Stakes upon User's Failure.

### 3.2 Recipient Types
Available Designated Recipients include:
- **Custom Recipient**: A friend, family member, or other individual invited by User
- **EOS**: The Company

### 3.3 Transfer of Forfeited Stakes
Upon Failure, Forfeited Stakes will be transferred to the Designated Recipient, less any applicable fees and transaction costs.

---

## 4. REPORTS AND VERIFICATION

### 4.1 Self-Reporting
User is responsible for reporting their success or failure by the required deadline. Failure to report by the deadline may be treated as a Failure.

### 4.2 Automatic Verification
Where available (e.g., Strava integration for run objectives), EOS may automatically verify Commitment completion. User authorizes EOS to access connected services for verification purposes.

### 4.3 Binding Reports
User agrees that reports—whether self-reported or automatically verified—are binding regarding whether User has kept the Commitment.

---

## 5. AGE REQUIREMENT

User represents and warrants that User is at least 18 years of age. Individuals under 18 are prohibited from setting Accountability Stakes.

---

## 6. NO REFUNDS

### 6.1 Non-Refundable
Forfeited Stakes are non-refundable except in cases of verified medical emergency at Company's sole discretion.

### 6.2 User Responsibility
User acknowledges they have voluntarily entered into this agreement and are solely responsible for achieving their Commitment.

---

## 7. HEALTH DISCLAIMER

### 7.1 Not Medical Advice
EOS is not a medical organization. Nothing in this agreement or the app should be construed as medical advice.

### 7.2 User Responsibility
User acknowledges that EOS has no knowledge of User's health condition and that User alone is responsible for whether the Commitment poses any health risks. User is advised to seek professional medical advice before beginning any health or fitness commitment.

### 7.3 Health Conditions
Users with active health conditions that would make their Commitment unhealthful should not set Stakes related to such Commitments.

---

## 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

### 8.1 As-Is Service
The EOS service and all materials are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind.

### 8.2 Liability Cap
In no event will EOS or its directors, employees, or agents be liable for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages. EOS's liability to User for any cause shall not exceed the Stakes amount at issue or $1,000, whichever is less.

---

## 9. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION

### 9.1 Contract Term
This agreement remains in effect for each active Commitment until Success or Failure in the final reporting period.

### 9.2 Cancellation
User may cancel their Commitment before the reporting period begins. Once a reporting period has started, the Commitment cannot be cancelled except in cases of verified medical emergency.

### 9.3 Company Rights
EOS reserves the right to cancel any Commitment that EOS, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate, unhealthful, illegal, or based on false information.
