        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 31, 2026</p>
        
        <p class="intro">
            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the EOS application and website (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>
        
        <h2>1. Overview of the Service</h2>
        <p>EOS is an accountability platform that enables users to commit to personal objectives and associate financial consequences with missed goals. Users may deposit funds, set daily objectives, and designate payout destinations—either charitable organizations or personal recipients—for amounts forfeited when objectives are not completed.</p>
        
        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To access certain features of the Service, you must create an account. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration</li>
            <li>Maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
            <li>Immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
            <li>Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or engage in fraudulent activity.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Deposits and Financial Transactions</h2>
        <p>The Service allows you to deposit funds into your EOS account balance. By making a deposit, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All payments are processed through Stripe, Inc., a third-party payment processor</li>
            <li>Deposited funds are held as account balance until disbursed per your objective settings</li>
            <li>Transaction fees may apply to deposits and withdrawals</li>
            <li>You are responsible for ensuring sufficient funds and valid payment methods</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Objectives and Payouts</h2>
        <p>When you commit to an objective and associated payout amount:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You authorize EOS to automatically deduct the committed amount from your balance if you fail to complete your objective by the specified deadline</li>
            <li>Objective completion is based on data you provide through the Service</li>
            <li>Deducted funds are disbursed to your designated destination (charity or personal recipient)</li>
            <li>Once an objective period has passed and a payout has been triggered, the transaction is final</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Charitable Donations:</strong> Funds designated for charitable giving are pooled and distributed to partner charitable organizations periodically, including at the end of each calendar year. EOS donates these funds on behalf of its user community. Individual tax receipts are not provided for payout amounts directed to charity through the Service.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>5. Personal Recipients</h2>
        <p>You may designate a personal recipient to receive your missed objective payouts. By doing so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You represent that you have authority to designate such recipient</li>
            <li>Recipients must create an EOS account to receive and withdraw funds</li>
            <li>EOS is not responsible for disputes between you and your designated recipient</li>
            <li>You may change your recipient designation at any time, subject to any pending committed payouts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Withdrawals</h2>
        <p>Users with positive account balances may request withdrawals subject to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity verification requirements</li>
            <li>Provision of valid banking information via Stripe Connect</li>
            <li>Processing times of approximately 3-7 business days</li>
            <li>Applicable minimum withdrawal amounts and fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EOS reserves the right to delay or refuse withdrawals if fraud or violation of these Terms is suspected.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>

            <li>Provide false or misleading information regarding objective completion</li>
            <li>Attempt to manipulate, reverse-engineer, or exploit the Service</li>
