        <h1>Terms of Service & Commitment Contract</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 4, 2026</p>
        
        <p class="intro">
            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the EOS application and website (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>
        
        <h2>1. Overview of the Service</h2>
        <p>EOS is a voluntary accountability platform that enables users to create commitment contracts for personal fitness objectives. Users may optionally set "Accountability Stakes"—money they put at risk to hold themselves accountable—and designate recipients who will receive forfeited stakes if objectives are not completed.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Setting Accountability Stakes is entirely optional. You may use EOS to track your fitness goals without any financial commitment. Stakes are a voluntary tool to increase motivation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>2. Commitment Contract</h2>
        <p>By setting Accountability Stakes in the EOS application, you enter into a commitment contract with the following terms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Commitment:</strong> You promise to perform your stated objective as specified in the app, including the objective type, target, deadline, and schedule you select.</li>
            <li><strong>Voluntary Stakes:</strong> You voluntarily choose to put money at risk. You represent that any stakes amount is an amount you can afford to lose.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk of Failure:</strong> You acknowledge that circumstances within or beyond your control may prevent you from achieving your commitment. <strong>YOU BEAR ALL RISK</strong> associated with your commitment.</li>
            <li><strong>Forfeiture:</strong> If you fail to complete your commitment by the specified deadline, your stakes for that period will be forfeited and transferred to your designated recipient.</li>
            <li><strong>Success:</strong> If you successfully complete your commitment, your stakes remain in your balance and are not forfeited.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To access certain features of the Service, you must create an account. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration</li>
            <li>Maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
            <li>Immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
            <li>Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or engage in fraudulent activity.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. Individuals under 18 are prohibited from setting Accountability Stakes.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Deposits and Financial Transactions</h2>
        <p>The Service allows you to deposit funds into your EOS account balance. By making a deposit, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All payments are processed through Stripe, Inc., a third-party payment processor</li>
            <li>Deposited funds are held as account balance until disbursed per your commitment settings</li>
            <li>Transaction fees may apply to deposits and withdrawals</li>
            <li>You are responsible for ensuring sufficient funds and valid payment methods</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Accountability Stakes and Forfeiture</h2>
        <p>When you set Accountability Stakes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You authorize EOS to automatically transfer the committed stakes amount from your balance to your designated recipient if you fail to complete your objective by the specified deadline</li>
            <li>Objective completion is based on data you provide through the Service or automatic verification where available</li>
            <li>Forfeited stakes are transferred to your designated recipient, less any applicable fees</li>
            <li>Once an objective period has passed and forfeiture has occurred, the transaction is final and non-refundable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Forfeited stakes are non-refundable except in cases of verified medical emergency at EOS's sole discretion. You acknowledge you have voluntarily entered into this commitment contract and are solely responsible for achieving your commitment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>7. Designated Recipients</h2>
        <p>You must select a designated recipient before setting stakes. Available recipient types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Recipient:</strong> A friend, family member, or other individual you invite</li>
            <li><strong>EOS:</strong> The company</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By designating a personal recipient:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You represent that you have authority to designate such recipient</li>
            <li>Recipients must create an EOS account to receive and withdraw funds</li>
            <li>EOS is not responsible for disputes between you and your designated recipient</li>
            <li>You may change your recipient designation at any time before stakes are committed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Reports and Verification</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for reporting your success or failure by the required deadline. Where available (e.g., Strava integration for run objectives), EOS may automatically verify commitment completion. You authorize EOS to access connected services for verification purposes. Reports—whether self-reported or automatically verified—are binding regarding whether you have kept your commitment.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Withdrawals</h2>
        <p>Users with positive account balances may request withdrawals subject to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity verification requirements</li>
            <li>Provision of valid banking information via Stripe Connect</li>
            <li>Processing times of approximately 3-7 business days</li>
            <li>Applicable minimum withdrawal amounts and fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EOS reserves the right to delay or refuse withdrawals if fraud or violation of these Terms is suspected.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>EOS is not a medical organization. Nothing in these Terms or the app should be construed as medical advice. You acknowledge that EOS has no knowledge of your health condition and that you alone are responsible for whether your commitment poses any health risks. You are advised to seek professional medical advice before beginning any health or fitness commitment.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws</li>
            <li>Provide false or misleading information regarding objective completion</li>
            <li>Attempt to manipulate, reverse-engineer, or exploit the Service</li>
            <li>Create multiple accounts to circumvent restrictions or abuse the Service</li>

            <li>Harass, abuse, or harm other users</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="caps">To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EOS and its officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or use, arising out of or related to your use of the Service, regardless of the theory of liability.</p>
        <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of the Service shall not exceed the stakes amount at issue or $1,000, whichever is less.</p>
        
        <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EOS and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising out of or related to your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another party.</p>

        <h2>18. Cancellation</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your commitment before the reporting period begins. Once a reporting period has started, the commitment cannot be cancelled except in cases of verified medical emergency. EOS reserves the right to cancel any commitment that EOS, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate, unhealthful, illegal, or based on false information.</p>
        
        <h2>19. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the Service or by email. Your continued use of the Service following any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>21. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
        
        <h2>22. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and EOS regarding your use of the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>
